  title    = {A Survey of Table Recognition: Models, Observations, Transformations, and Inferences},
  abstract = {Table characteristics vary widely. Consequently, a great variety of computational approaches
have been applied to table recognition. In this survey, the table recognition literature is
presented as an interaction of table models, observations, transformations and inferences. A
table model defines the physical and logical structure of tables; the model is used to detect
tables, and to analyze and decompose the detected tables. Observations perform feature
measurements and data lookup, transformations alter or restructure data, and inferences
generate and test hypotheses. This presentation clarifies the decisions that are made by a table
recognizer, and the assumptions and inferencing techniques that underlie these decisions.},

  abstract    = {This dissertation investigates the composition of high-quality tables with the use of electronic tools. A generic model is designed to support the different stages of tabular composition, including the editing of logical structure, the specification of layout
structure, and the formatting of concrete tables. The model separates table's logical
structure from its layout structure, which consists of tabular topology and typographic
style. The notion of an abstract table, which describes the logical relationships among
tabular items, is formally defined and a set of logical operations is proposed to manipulate tables based on these logical relationships. An abstract table can be visualized
through a layout structure specified by a set of topological rules, which determine the
relative placement of tabular items in two dimensions, and a set of style rules, which
determine the final appearance of different items. The absolute placement of a concrete
table can be automatically generated by applying a layout specification to an abstract
table. An NP-complete problem arises in the formatting process that uses automatic
line breaking and determines the physical dimension of a table to satisfy user-specified
size constraints. An algorithm has been designed to solve the formatting problem in
polynomial time for typical tables. Based on the tabular model, a prototype tabular
composition system has been implemented in a UNIX, X Windows environment. This
prototype provides an interactive interface to edit the logical structure, the topology and
the styles of tables. It allows us to manipulate tables based on the logical relationships
of tabular items, regardless of where the items are placed in the layout structure, and
is capable of presenting a table in different topologies and styles so that we can select a
high-quality layout structure.},

regions in document images by identifying the column and row line-separators and their properties. The method employs a run-length approach to identify the horizontal and vertical lines present in the input image. From each group of intersecting
horizontal and vertical lines, a set of 26 low-level features are extracted and an SVM classifier is used to test if it belongs to a table or not. The performance of the method is evaluated on a
heterogeneous corpus of French, English and Arabic documents that contain various types of table structures and compared with that of the Tesseract OCR system.},
